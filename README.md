# Building Applications with React and Redux in ES6 (Pluralsight)

This project is based on the [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) course [Building Applications with React and Redux in ES6](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/react-redux-react-router-es6) by [Daniel Stern](https://github.com/danielstern).

## Installation
Assuming you have `npm` & `node.js` installed, you can either clone or download the repository. Navigate to the folder that you/was created. Then, run `npm install` on the command line to download the dependencies. Finally, run `npm start` to launch to the project in development mode, or `npm run build` in production mode.

## Description
The course teaches building a React app from the ground up, meaning it begins by instructing on how to buils a JS Development environment. The course was authored in 2016, making the versions of the tools it uses, but not the tools themselves, obsolete. I'm trying to update every dependency to its newest version and configure all of them to play nice with each other. The one constant is that I'm still using Webpack 1.
