# Building Applications with React and Redux in ES6 (Pluralsight)

This project is based on the [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) course [Building Applications with React and Redux in ES6](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/react-redux-react-router-es6) by [Daniel Stern](https://github.com/danielstern).

The course teaches building a React app from the ground up, as it begins by instructing on how to buils a JS Development environment.

The course was authored in 2016, making the versions of the tools it uses (but not the tools themselves) obsolete. 

I'm trying to update every dependency to its newest version and configure all of them to play nice with each other.
